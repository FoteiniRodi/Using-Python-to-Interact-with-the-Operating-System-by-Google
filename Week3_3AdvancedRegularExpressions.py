SYNOPSIS

3.1        Capturing Groups
capturing groups uses () parentheses in the pattern in order to match specific information in the text
I can write a very long pattern and then choose what I want to be returned by using parenthesis.
after using capturing groups I can use indexing x[1], x[2] on the match object x to use the matches I have found

for a pattern with 2 parentheses, and a text with 2 strings, search() and print(x) produces one text with 2 strings (the match)
I can print(x[1]) to get the match for the 1st pattern parenthesis 
I can print (x[2]) to get the match for the 2nd pattern parenthesis 
Attention: with x[0] I get the whole match not 1st pattern parenthesis  etc.

Method groups() 
APPLY IT ON THE MATCH OBJECT: x.groups() and get a tuple whose elements are the pattern parentheses/groups. 

          Pattern                                           Use
          r"^(\w*), (\w*)$", "Lovelace, Ada"                2 groups enclosed in parentheses
          r"^([\w \.-]*), ([\w \.-]*)$","Kennedy, John F."  2 groups
                                                            [] used to escape special character. and also to apply the * to each enclosed character
                                                            the beginning^ and the ending$ are applied on the parentheses
                                                    
Note: special characters 1) inside [] and 2) after \, lose their special meaning

3.2        More on Repetition Qualifiers

repetition qualifiers = *, +, ?
numeric repetition qualifiers = {m, n}      finds preceding repeated characters. Repetition now is quantified. (start, end)
                                {5}         find repetition of preceding regex, of exactly 5 characters (exact number)
                                {5,10}      find repetition of preceding regex, of 5 to 10 characters (lower and upper boundary)
                                {5,}        find repetition of preceding regex, of AT LEAST 5 up to unlimited characters (lower boundary. Upper is defined by the text itself!)
                                [,20]       find repetition of preceding regex, of UP TO 20 characters or less (upper boundary. )


        Pattern                                         Use
        r"[a-zA-Z]{5}", "a ghost"                       finds 5 repeating characters (characters can be any aplhabet letter lowercase or uppercase)
        (r"\b[a-zA-Z]{5}\b", "a scary ghost appeared")  finds 5 repeating characters, but only full words not part of words

Note: use \b to get FULL WORDS!use \b at the begging and end of the pattern to indicate that I want matches that are words, not parts of words!

3.3        Extracting a PID Using regexes in Python
pattern r"\[(\d+)\], we want to find any numbers within []
capturing group is inside the parenthesis
( I can create as many capturing groups as i like
then i can index x based on these capturing groups)
backslash \ is used to treat following characters LITERALLY
so i use\ before [] and another \ before ]. Finallly [, and ], are treated litterally
    
\d is a special sequence, finds numbers 0-9
\d+ special sequence with repeating qualifier + which find one or more repetitions

INDEXING THE MATCH OBJECT
x: match object
if we use capturing groups in the pattern then I can index the x like this:
    x[1] is the 1st capturing group
    x[2] is the 2nd capturing group

3.4        Splitting and Replacing
we can escape characters in 2 ways
use \
place them inside []

methods in the regex module re
search()
findall()

split()         splits our text at specified points
                produces a list. Elements are parts of the text we splitted
                splitting elements are not included in the result, unless we use capturing groups ()
                
                Pattern                                                    Use
                r"[.?!]", "One sentence. Another one? And the last one!"   split the text using 3 splitting elements
                                                                           I will get 4 parts
                                                                           splitting elements do not appear in the results
                r"([.?!])", "One sentence. Another one? And the last one!" split the text using 3 splitting elements
                                                                           I will get 4 parts
                                                                           now the splitting elements appear in the results but independently

sub()           The sub() function replaces the matches with the text of our choice
                syntax is: x = re.sub(pattern, text of our choice, text)
                x = re.sub(r"","", "")
                so we replace something in the text with something we have chosen
                
                Pattern                                                                              Use
                r"[\w.%+-]+@[\w.-]+","REDACTED", "Received an email for go_nuts95@my.example.com"    replace go_nuts95@my.example.com with REDACTED
                r"^([\w .-]*), ([\w .-]*)$", r"\2 \1", "Lovelace, Ada"                               replace parenthesis 2 with 1, replace parenthesis 1 with 2 (REVERSE ORDER!)
                
| pipe or vertical bar
use the pipe symbol |, to match either one expression or another

This regular expression uses "the" and "a" as delimiters, no matter where they are in the text, 
even in the middle of other words like "Another" and "last".

"""

"""
3.1        Capturing Groups using () in the pattern separated by comma

until now we searched for a pattern inside a text, found a match and then printed the match.
now we will use the match and use it to do something else

For example, we may want to extract the hostname or a process ID from a log line and use that value for another operation
For that we need to use a concept of regular expressions called capturing groups

CAPTURING GROUPS = portions of the pattern that are enclosed in parentheses

Let's say that we have a list of people's full names. 
These names are stored as last name, comma, first name.
 We want to turn this around and create a string that starts with the first name followed by the last name. 
We can do this using a regular expression with capturing groups. 


re.search(r"pattern", "text") produces x, the match object
for a pattern with 2 parentheses and a text with 2 strings print(x) produces one text with 2 strings (the match)
I can choose string1 and string 2 from x with indexing
beware! x[0] gives me the whole match, x[1] gives me the 1st string of text/1st () of pattern and x[2] gives me 2nd string of text/2nd () of pattern
x.groups() will produce a tuple with 2 elements, the 2 strings of the text
I will not use findall() because this produces a list with 1 tuple as an element:)

"""
In-video question
Fix the regular expression used in the rearrange_name function so that it can match
 middle names, middle initials, as well as double surnames.
 What we need to do here is add the extra characters that we want to allow in the names.
 In this example we'd want to add spaces and dots.
 
CORRECTION
The correct regular expression should be: "^([\w \.-]*), ([\w \.-]*)$"
1st () in pattern:
^ should start with this ()
\w find alphanumeric 
\. find actual dot
- find dash
enclose all above, in [] and use star * to find all repetitions of preceding characters
2nd () in pattern:
same contents in [], again use star*
at the end of parenthesis, use $ to indicate that this should be the end
    
Note: for star* to be applied to all regex, I enclose them in []

Un-escaped, the dot in this expression will match any character. 
In this case it makes the code work, but it is incorrect! 
Since we wanted to match the dot character specifically, we should have escaped the dot in the regular expression.

as implemented in the following code. What is the resulting split list?

| pipe or vertical bar
use the pipe symbol |, to match either one expression or another

This regular expression uses "the" and "a" as delimiters, no matter where they are in the text,

QUESTION 4
The transform_comments function 
converts comments in a Python script into those usable by a C compiler. 
This means looking for text that begins with a hash mark (#) 
and replacing it with double slashes (//), which is the C single-line comment indicator. 
For the purpose of this exercise, 
we'll ignore the possibility of a hash mark embedded inside of a Python command, 
and assume that it's only used to indicate a comment. 
We also want to treat repetitive hash marks (##), (###), etc., as a single comment indicator,
 to be replaced with just (//) and not (#//) or (//#). 
 Fill in the parameters of the substitution method to complete this function:
